## 🔍 Issues Identified & Fixed

### **Problem**: Poor text contrast in light mode
- Text was too light and hard to read
- Some elements became nearly invisible in light mode  
- Dark mode worked fine, but light mode was problematic

### **Solutions Applied**:

#### **1. Case Parameter Text**
- **Before**: `color: #34495e` (medium gray)
- **After**: `color: #2c3e50` (darker gray)
- **Effect**: Much better contrast and readability

#### **2. Diagnosis Values**
- **Before**: `font-weight: 500`, `color: #34495e`
- **After**: `font-weight: 600`, `color: #2c3e50`  
- **Effect**: Bolder, more readable text

#### **3. Pattern Descriptions**
- **Before**: `color: #7f8c8d` (light gray - hard to read)
- **After**: `color: #2c3e50`, `font-weight: 500`
- **Effect**: Much better contrast and readability

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the fixes:

2. **Check** that all text is clearly readable
3. **Switch** to dark mode and verify it still works well  
4. **Select** a case and run simulation
5. **Verify** case parameters, simulation log, and diagnosis are all readable

**Both light and dark modes should now provide excellent readability! 🎉**
