# 🧠⚡ Neural Detective: Action Potential Treatment Laboratory

An interactive educational web application that teaches action potential concepts through investigation, diagnosis, and treatment of neurological cases. Students act as neuroscientists to investigate patient symptoms, diagnose problems, and apply treatments using parameter adjustment.

## 🎯 Overview

Neural Detective provides a complete **Investigate → Diagnose → Treat** educational workflow. Students examine neurological cases, run simulations to understand the problems, receive diagnostic guidance, and use an interactive Treatment Laboratory to fix the neuronal dysfunction by adjusting clinically relevant parameters.

### ✨ Key Features
- **🔬 Treatment Laboratory**: Interactive parameter dials for hands-on treatment
- **📊 Real-time Feedback**: Immediate treatment effectiveness evaluation
- **🧬 Realistic Cases**: Biologically accurate neurological conditions
- **⚡ Instant Results**: Live simulation with visual feedback

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Students
1. Open the web interface
2. Select a patient case to investigate
3. Run simulations and observe the results
4. Form hypotheses about what's wrong
5. Use the diagnosis feature to check your work
6. Dial in the parameters to treat the condition

## 🔬 The Cases

### Case A: High Threshold
**Symptoms**: Complete loss of reflexes
**Challenge**: Why won't this neuron fire?

### Case B: Hyperexcitability  
**Symptoms**: Seizure-like activity
**Challenge**: Why does this neuron fire too much?

### Case C: Poor Reset
**Symptoms**: Abnormal reflex patterns
**Challenge**: Why won't this neuron reset properly?

### Case D: Weak Input
**Symptoms**: Reduced sensory responses
**Challenge**: Why is this neuron so insensitive?

### Normal Control
**Reference**: Healthy neuron for comparison
