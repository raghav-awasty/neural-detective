# ‚ö°Ô∏è Neural Detective: The Broken Circuit
## Student Investigation Handout

### üßæ Mission Briefing

Welcome, Neural Detectives! You've been called to investigate a mysterious case at the Neural Research Hospital. Several patients are presenting with unusual neurological symptoms - their reflexes aren't working normally. As expert neuroscientists, your job is to simulate their neurons in code and figure out what's malfunctioning.

**Your Mission:** Diagnose faulty neurons by running computational simulations and analyzing the results.

### üéØ Learning Goals

By completing this investigation, you will:

1. **Understand Action Potentials**: Learn how neurons generate electrical signals
2. **Explore Threshold Effects**: See how voltage thresholds control neuron firing
3. **Investigate Reset Mechanisms**: Discover why proper repolarization matters
4. **Analyze Stimulus Strength**: Understand how input affects neuronal responses
5. **Practice Scientific Debugging**: Use systematic approaches to diagnose problems
6. **Connect Biology to Code**: See how computational models help us understand biology

### üß¨ Background: How Neurons Work

Before diving into the investigation, let's review the basics:

**Resting Potential**: Healthy neurons maintain a voltage of about -70mV when at rest.

**Threshold**: When stimulated, if the neuron's voltage reaches about -55mV, it fires an action potential.

**Action Potential**: The neuron's voltage rapidly spikes to +30mV, then resets.

**Reset/Repolarization**: After firing, the neuron returns to its resting potential (-70mV).

**Stimulus**: External input that increases the neuron's voltage each time step.

### üîç The Case Files

You have **four mystery patients** to investigate, plus one healthy control for comparison:

#### **Case B - Mystery Patient #2** 
*Symptoms*: Hyperactive reflexes, seizure-like activity
*Your Job*: Determine why this neuron fires too much

#### **Case C - Mystery Patient #3**
*Symptoms*: Abnormal reflex patterns, prolonged responses
*Your Job*: Identify the reset mechanism problem

#### **Case D - Mystery Patient #4**
*Symptoms*: Weak reflexes, delayed responses
*Your Job*: Figure out the input sensitivity issue

### üìù Investigation Protocol

Follow these steps for each case:

#### **Step 1: Initial Observation**
1. Select a patient case
2. Run the simulation with default parameters (20 time steps)
3. Record your observations:
   - How many spikes occurred?
   - What was the firing pattern?
   - Did anything look abnormal?

#### **Step 2: Parameter Analysis**
Review the patient's neuron parameters:
- **Threshold Voltage**: ___ mV
- **Reset Voltage**: ___ mV  
- **Stimulus Strength**: ___ mV per step
- **Initial Voltage**: ___ mV

#### **Step 3: Pattern Recognition**
Compare your results to these known patterns:

| Problem Type | Spike Count | Pattern | Likely Cause |
|--------------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| High Threshold | 0 spikes | Voltage rises but never fires | Threshold too high |
| Low Threshold | Many spikes | Fires almost every step | Threshold too low |
| Bad Reset | Irregular | Fires once then abnormal pattern | Reset voltage wrong |
| Weak Stimulus | Few spikes | Voltage climbs very slowly | Stimulus too weak |

#### **Step 4: Hypothesis Formation**
Based on your observations, hypothesize:
- Which parameter is faulty?
- What would a normal value be?
- How would you fix this neuron?

#### **Step 5: Diagnosis Verification**
Use the "Reveal Diagnosis" feature to check your hypothesis!

### üìö Quick Reference

**Key Vocabulary:**
- **Action Potential**: The electrical signal neurons use to communicate
- **Threshold**: The voltage level that triggers an action potential  
- **Repolarization**: The process of returning to resting potential
