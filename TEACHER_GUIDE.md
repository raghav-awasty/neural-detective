## üìñ Case Descriptions & Solutions

### **Case A: High Threshold (-20mV)**
**Symptoms**: Complete loss of reflexes, no response to stimuli
**Problem**: Threshold voltage is too high for normal stimulus to reach
**Expected Results**: 0 spikes, voltage climbs but never crosses threshold
**Learning Focus**: Critical role of threshold in action potential initiation
**Real-World Connection**: Some anesthetics work by raising threshold voltage

### **Case B: Low Threshold (-80mV)**  
**Symptoms**: Hyperactive reflexes, seizure-like activity
**Problem**: Threshold voltage is too low, fires with minimal stimulus
**Expected Results**: Spikes almost every time step (high firing rate)
**Learning Focus**: How hyperexcitability leads to pathological conditions
**Real-World Connection**: Some forms of epilepsy involve lowered firing thresholds

### **Case C: Poor Reset (-40mV)**
**Symptoms**: Abnormal reflex patterns, prolonged responses  
**Problem**: Reset voltage is too high, neuron stays partially depolarized
**Expected Results**: Irregular firing pattern, may fire multiple times quickly
**Learning Focus**: Importance of proper repolarization in normal function
**Real-World Connection**: K+ channel dysfunction can impair repolarization

### **Case D: Weak Stimulus (2mV)**
**Symptoms**: Weak reflexes, delayed responses
**Problem**: Stimulus strength is too low to reliably reach threshold
**Expected Results**: Infrequent firing, maybe 1-2 spikes in 20 steps
**Learning Focus**: How input strength affects response probability
**Real-World Connection**: Sensory neuropathies can reduce signal transmission

### **Normal Control (Standard Parameters)**
**Purpose**: Baseline for comparison
**Expected Results**: Moderate firing rate (~25-40%), regular pattern
**Parameters**: Threshold -55mV, Reset -70mV, Stimulus 5mV
